# Advent of Code

My solutions for Advent of Code challenges.

## Note

These solutions are preserved exactly as they were when I first solved each puzzle. I stopped working on them the moment I got the correct answer. They are unoptimised and most certainly are inefficient, as I wish to document my progress authentically as I grow as an engineer.

I'll come back to these later when I'm more experienced and refactor them to see how much I've improved.

## Running Solutions

Each solution can be run independently with Go:

```bash
go run part-1.go
go run part-2.go
```

## Language

Solutions are written in Go.
